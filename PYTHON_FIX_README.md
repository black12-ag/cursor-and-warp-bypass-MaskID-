# Bypass Tools Suite - Python Dependencies Fix

## Issue Description

The Bypass Tools Suite macOS app was failing with the following errors:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'colorama'
```

This occurred because the `check_user_authorized.py` script imports both the `requests` and `colorama` modules, but they weren't properly available in the app's Python environment when the app was built.

## Root Cause

The Electron app bundles Python scripts from the `backend/` directory, but several required Python modules weren't properly included in the app's Python environment:

- `requests` - HTTP library for Python
- `urllib3` - HTTP client for Python  
- `certifi` - Certificate bundle for SSL verification
- `charset_normalizer` - Character encoding detection
- `idna` - Internationalized Domain Names support
- `colorama` - Cross-platform colored terminal text

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed requirements.txt files

Updated both source requirements.txt files to include missing dependencies:

- `/backend/requirements.txt` - Updated with `requests>=2.25.0`
- `/cursor-bypass-tool/requirements.txt` - Already had requests listed

### 2. Fixed the installed app

Manually copied the missing Python modules to the installed app:
```
/Applications/Bypass Tools Suite.app/Contents/Resources/backend/
```

### 3. Rebuilt the app with fixes

- Rebuilt the Electron app using `npm run dist`
- Copied the Python dependencies to both x64 and ARM64 builds

### 4. Created automation script

Created `fix_python_deps.sh` script that automatically:
- Detects the system Python installation
- Copies required dependencies to the built apps
- Works for both installed and built versions

### 5. Updated build process

Modified `package.json` to automatically run the fix script after building:
```json
"dist": "npm run build && electron-builder && ./fix_python_deps.sh",
"dist-all": "npm run build && electron-builder -mwl && ./fix_python_deps.sh"
```

## Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Successfully importing requests in the app's Python environment
2. Testing both the installed app and newly built versions
3. Confirming the error no longer occurs

## Future Builds

For future builds, the process is now automated:
1. Run `npm run dist` - builds the app and automatically applies Python fixes
2. Or manually run `./fix_python_deps.sh` after any build

## Files Modified

- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added missing requests dependency
- `package.json` - Updated build scripts to include Python fix
- `fix_python_deps.sh` - New automation script (created)
- `PYTHON_FIX_README.md` - This documentation (created)

## Status

âœ… **FIXED** - The Bypass Tools Suite now works correctly with all required Python dependencies included.
